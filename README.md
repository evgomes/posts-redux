# Posts - Redux

Sample Angular 7 application built to show how to integrate Angular and Redux using the [@angular-redux/store](https://github.com/angular-redux/platform/tree/master/packages/store) library.

The application lists posts from [JSONPlaceholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and displays them on the screen, but everything integrated with Redux.
